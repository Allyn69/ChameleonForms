Extending Form Components
=========================

If you would like to extend form components you can easily create extension methods on the relevant classes.

The `FieldFor` extension methods on the `Section` class are a great example.

There is nothing stopping you creating similar methods, or even creating your own form components by extending the `FormComponent` class.

If you have a specific DSL you would like to achieve using ChameleonForms and need some assistance feel free to communicate with us via Twitter [@robdmoore](http://twitter.com/robdmoore) / [@mdaviesnet](http://twitter.com/mdaviesnet) or alternatively send a pull request / issue to this GitHub project.
